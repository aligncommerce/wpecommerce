== Description ==

AcceptBitcoin

Bitcoin is fast becoming a way to purchase physical goods and services worldwide and an increasing number of businesses are offering this crypto-currency as an alternative to more traditional forms of payments. Bitcoin's high cryptographic security allows businesses to process transactions in an efficient and cost effective way by eliminating reversals and chargebacks. Accepting Bitcoin payments also helps attract a young and tech-savvy audience, who are eager to find new businesses where they can spend their Bitcoins on. 

PayinLocal

Whether it be a merchant in the United States accepting Euros from a website visitor in Germany or a small Philippine consulting firm invoicing for services provided in the US, our PayinLocal platform automatically converts foreign currencies to your local currency. Align Commerce utilizes the transmission technology behind the most popular and efficient cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin allowing you to receive international payments to your bank account in a seamless and inexpensive manner.
